Your database design and databas tables files goes into this folder. (MySQL.mwb files, SQL database files)

IMPORTANT NOTE:

Since SurveiRams is developed using a combination of JavaScript framework called Quasar, and Firebase, the system does not provide direct access to the underlying SQL database. Firebase is a NoSQL cloud-based platform that provides various services, including real-time database, authentication, storage, and more. The Firebase Realtime Database uses a JSON-based structure for data storage and retrieval, not SQL.

Firebase is a different type of database compared to traditional SQL databases. It offers real-time synchronization, automatic scaling, and other features specific to NoSQL databases, so the data structure and querying mechanisms are different.
